Some example runs are provided in "examples.m" file of this repository. The codes are written in Matlab. Add all the .m files to a single folder before executing the code.

You can download "BhattacherjeeLung2001.txt" and "WangBreast2005.txt" from Prof. Wang's repository, https://www.dropbox.com/sh/l5ul024bx48reqj/AACx3-MW9Pm4bKkmxTbxZK0sa/Data?dl=0&subfolder_nav_tracking=1 and put it in the microarray folder. The folder "My data" (~200MB) contains the synthetic and simulated data used in the experiments.
